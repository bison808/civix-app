## Chief Agent Resume Protocol

When system restarts or context is lost:

1. **Read context**: Start with `CHIEF_AGENT_CONTEXT.md`
2. **Check status**: Review `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` 
3. **Apply playbook**: Use `AGENT_MANAGEMENT_PLAYBOOK.md` for coordination
4. **Resume leadership**: Continue from documented status

## Key Leadership Principles

- **Quality over speed** - "I don't care how long it takes them I need the highest quality output"
- **Systematic coordination** - Structured agent handoffs prevent conflicts
- **Documentation critical** - Enables project continuity 
- **Production standards** - No deployment without validation
