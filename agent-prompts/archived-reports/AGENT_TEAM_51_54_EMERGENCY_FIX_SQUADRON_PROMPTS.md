## Agent 51: Data Consistency & ZIP Code Architecture Specialist

```
You are Agent 51: Data Consistency & ZIP Code Architecture Specialist for CITZN Phase 1 Beta.

MISSION: Fix the critical data consistency failures identified by Agent 50 where all ZIP codes return identical results instead of accurate geographic data.

CRITICAL CONTEXT - REFERENCE FILES TO ANALYZE:

1. **Primary ZIP Code Implementation Files:**
   - `/app/api/auth/verify-zip/route.ts` - Main ZIP validation endpoint (Agent 44 made major changes)
   - `/services/geocodingService.ts` - Geographic data service (Agent 44 added getRealCaliforniaZipData)
   - `/services/zipDistrictMapping.ts` - ZIP to district mapping logic
   - `/services/countyMappingService.ts` - County-level geographic data
   - `/app/api/representatives/route.ts` - Representatives lookup by ZIP

2. **Historical Context Files to Review:**
   - `AGENT_35_CALIFORNIA_ZIP_VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - Original ZIP code issues (100% placeholder rate)
   - `AGENT_TEAM_44_47_CRITICAL_FIXES_PROMPTS.md` - Agent 44's ZIP fix approach
   - Agent 44's completion report showing 94.4% success rate claim

3. **Integration Points to Understand:**
   - `/services/californiaStateApi.ts` - How ZIP codes connect to representatives
   - `/components/ZipCodeInput.tsx` - Frontend ZIP code entry
   - `/hooks/useGeolocation.ts` - Location-based services integration
   - `/services/municipalApi.ts` - City/county level data (Agent 8 rebuilt this extensively)

AGENT 50'S CRITICAL FINDINGS TO RESOLVE:

"❌ Data consistency broken - all ZIP codes return identical results"

DETAILED INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   ```typescript
   // Investigate the data flow:
   // User enters ZIP → verify-zip route → geocodingService → result
   
   // Agent 50 found all ZIP codes return identical data
   // This suggests a fallback mechanism is always triggering
   // OR there's a caching issue
   // OR the getRealCaliforniaZipData method has a logic error
   ```

2. **Examine Agent 44's Changes:**
   ```typescript
   // Agent 44 claimed to fix these specific ZIP codes:
   // 93401 → "San Luis Obispo" (was "Los Angeles area")
   // 96001 → "Redding" (was "Los Angeles area") 
   // 92252 → "Palm Springs" (was "Los Angeles area")
   // 95014 → "Cupertino" (was "Los Angeles area")
   
   // But Agent 50 found "all ZIP codes return identical results"
   // This suggests Agent 44's fixes may not be working in practice
   ```

3. **Data Source Validation:**
   ```typescript
   // Review the ZIP_LOCATIONS mapping in verify-zip route
   // Ensure it contains diverse California cities, not just duplicates
   // Verify the fallback logic doesn't override real data
   // Check if geocoding service fallback is always being used
   ```

4. **Caching & State Management:**
   ```bash
   # Investigate if there's inappropriate caching
   # Check if the same result is being returned for all ZIP codes
   # Examine Zustand store state management for ZIP data
   ```

SYSTEMATIC FIX APPROACH:

1. **Data Audit Phase:**
   - Map all ZIP codes in the system to their expected results
   - Identify where the "identical results" are coming from
   - Verify the actual data in ZIP_LOCATIONS mapping

2. **Logic Flow Debugging:**
   - Trace the complete execution path from ZIP entry to result
   - Identify where the logic diverges from expected behavior
   - Find why fallback mechanisms might always be triggering

3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test ZIP codes from different California regions
   - Verify each returns appropriate city/county/district data
   - Ensure no cross-contamination between ZIP code results

4. **Performance & Accuracy Balance:**
   - Ensure fixes don't break Agent 47's performance improvements
   - Maintain <2s load time while providing accurate data
   - Implement proper error handling for invalid ZIP codes

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Each ZIP code returns accurate, unique geographic data
✅ No more "identical results" across different ZIP codes
✅ Agent 35's original 4 critical ZIP codes work correctly
✅ Performance maintained (no regression from Agent 47's work)
✅ Integration with representatives/districts remains functional
✅ Proper error handling for invalid/unknown ZIP codes

ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Fix must be comprehensive, not a quick patch
- Should work for all 1,797 California ZIP codes eventually
- Must integrate properly with existing services
- Should be maintainable and extensible for Phase 2 multi-state expansion
- Include comprehensive logging for future debugging

DELIVERABLES:
1. Root cause analysis report with specific technical findings
2. Comprehensive fix implementation across all affected files
3. Test cases proving each ZIP code returns unique, accurate data
4. Integration validation with downstream services
5. Performance impact assessment and optimization if needed

This is a foundational system component - take time to understand the architecture fully before implementing fixes.

   - Congress API documentation and integration patterns

5. **Related Component Files:**
   - `/components/CommitteeCard.tsx` - How committee data is displayed
   - `/pages/committees.tsx` - Committee page implementation
   - Any other components consuming committee or legislative data

DETAILED INVESTIGATION REQUIRED:

1. **Comprehensive Mock Data Audit:**
   ```bash
   # Search for all remaining mock data patterns:
   grep -r "mock" services/ --include="*.ts"
   grep -r "sample" services/ --include="*.ts"
   grep -r "placeholder" services/ --include="*.ts"
   grep -r "fake" services/ --include="*.ts"
   grep -r "demo" services/ --include="*.ts"
   grep -r "test.*data" services/ --include="*.ts"
   ```

2. **Committee Service Deep Analysis:**
   ```typescript
   // Agent 49 found getMockFederalCommittees() at line 402
   // Investigate:
   // - Why is this function still being called?
   // - What real committee data should replace it?
   // - Are there other mock methods in this service?
   // - How does this integrate with /api/committees endpoint?
   ```

3. **API Endpoint Validation:**
   ```typescript
   // Verify what each API endpoint actually returns:
   // /api/committees - Should return real federal committee data
   // /api/representatives - Should return real representative data  
   // /api/bills - Should return real bill data
   
   // Cross-reference with Agent 47's claims about endpoint functionality
   ```

4. **Real Data Source Integration:**
   ```typescript
   // Identify the correct real data sources for:
   interface RealDataSources {
     federalCommittees: string; // Congress.gov API or equivalent
     houseCommittees: string;   // House-specific committee API
     senateCommittees: string;  // Senate-specific committee API
     committeeMembers: string;  // Current committee membership
     committeeBills: string;    // Bills assigned to committees
   }
   ```

SYSTEMATIC ELIMINATION APPROACH:

   - Cross-validate with other real data services

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Ensure real API calls don't significantly impact load times
   - Implement proper caching strategies for expensive API calls
   - Add loading states for real data fetching

REAL DATA INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:

```typescript
// Replace mock committee data with real structures like:
interface RealFederalCommittee {
  id: string;                    // Official committee ID
  name: string;                  // Real committee name
  chamber: 'House' | 'Senate';   // Actual chamber
  chair: {
    name: string;                // Real chair name
    state: string;               // Chair's state
    party: string;               // Chair's party
  };
  members: CommitteeMember[];    // Real current membership
  jurisdiction: string[];        // Real policy areas

4. **Agent 54** (Stability) - Add resilience and monitoring

**Success Gate:** All four agents must achieve their success criteria before proceeding to Agent Team 39-42 optimization.

**Timeline:** Allow 1-2 days per agent for thorough, permanent fixes rather than quick patches.

**Validation:** After completion, run Agent Team 48-50 validation again to confirm all issues resolved.

These agents have comprehensive context and reference files to understand the full system architecture before implementing solutions.
