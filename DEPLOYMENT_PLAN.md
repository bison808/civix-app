node test-auth-persistence.js

# Verify token refresh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3008/api/auth/refresh

# Check session across tabs
# Open multiple tabs and verify auth state
```

**Deployment Commands:**

# Touch target verification
# Ensure all buttons are min 48x48px
```

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
git add app/globals.css components/bills/MobileBillCard.tsx components/bills/BillFeed.tsx

### PHASE 3: Performance Optimizations (1:40 PM)
**Files to Deploy:**
- `next.config.js`
- `lib/performance.ts`
- `components/LazyLoad.tsx`
- `components/OptimizedImage.tsx`
- `performance/*`
- `package.json` (web-vitals addition)

**Testing Required:**
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run build
npm run analyze

# Check bundle size
# Verify < 200KB initial bundle

# Test Core Web Vitals
# FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1
```

**Deployment Commands:**
```bash
git add next.config.js lib/performance.ts components/LazyLoad.tsx
git add components/OptimizedImage.tsx performance/ package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "perf: optimize bundle and runtime performance

```

### PHASE 4: Bills API & Local Reps (3:45 PM) - PENDING
**Expected Files:**
- `services/congressService.ts`
- `services/civicInfoService.ts`
- `services/realDataService.ts`
- `app/api/bills/route.ts`
- `app/feed/page.tsx`
- `app/representatives/page.tsx`

**Pre-deployment Requirements:**
- API keys configured in .env
- Rate limiting tested
- Error handling verified

## üîç CONFLICT ANALYSIS

### No Conflicts Detected ‚úÖ
- Authentication changes isolated to auth-specific files
- Mobile changes primarily CSS and new components
- Performance changes in config and optimization layers
- Bills API changes in services layer (no overlap)

### Potential Integration Points
1. **Auth + Mobile**: Mobile nav needs auth state (compatible)
2. **Performance + Mobile**: Lazy loading benefits mobile (synergistic)
3. **Auth + Bills API**: API calls need auth tokens (compatible)
