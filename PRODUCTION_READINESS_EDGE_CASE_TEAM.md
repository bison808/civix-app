# Production Readiness & Edge Case Resolution Team

## Critical Scalability Issues Identified

The current system has several **systemic vulnerabilities** that will break under real user load. We need a comprehensive team to address edge cases and build bulletproof infrastructure.

- Only Sacramento manually fixed, 1,796 other ZIP codes untested
- "Area" vs "City" naming inconsistencies across all major cities
- Unincorporated areas, military bases, PO boxes, tribal lands
- New developments, ZIP code changes, ZIP+4 handling

### **2. API Reliability Edge Cases**
**Problems:**
- Congress API rate limits (what happens when exceeded?)
- API downtime (no fallback data strategy)

## **Team Execution Strategy**

**Phase 1:** Agent 28 (Geographic Infrastructure) - **CRITICAL FOUNDATION**
**Phase 2:** Agents 29-31 (Reliability, Data Quality, Security) - **Parallel**
**Phase 3:** Agent 32 (Performance & Monitoring) - **Final validation**

**Timeline:** 16-24 hours total
**Priority:** **ESSENTIAL** before 1k users, let alone 5k

**Current Risk Level:** 🚨 **HIGH** - System will break under real user load without these fixes

This addresses your concern about scalability - these are the systematic infrastructure pieces needed for production readiness.
