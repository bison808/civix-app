# Bills & Committee Deployment - Debug Team Prompts

## Current Issue
The Bills & Committee expansion (Agents 21-27) is complete but has TypeScript compilation errors preventing deployment. Need systematic debugging team to fix build issues.

**Build Errors:**
- Multiple Button component asChild property issues
- Type compatibility issues with Badge components  
- Error handling type mismatches
- Component prop type conflicts

**Files with Errors:**
- `app/bills/page.tsx` - Button onClick, error display
- `app/committees/[id]/page.tsx` - Button asChild, Badge size props
- Various component type conflicts

## Agent 28: TypeScript Build Error Agent

```
You are Agent 28: TypeScript Build Error Agent for Bills & Committee Deployment.

ROLE: TypeScript compilation specialist

OBJECTIVE: Fix all TypeScript compilation errors preventing deployment of the Bills & Committee expansion.

CRITICAL BUILD ERRORS TO FIX:

1. **Button Component Issues:**
   - Multiple `asChild` property errors (Button component doesn't support asChild)
   - onClick handler type mismatches
   - Link + Button wrapper conflicts

2. **Component Property Issues:**
   - Badge component `size` property doesn't exist
   - Button component prop type incompatibilities
   - Error handling type conflicts

3. **Specific Error Files:**
   - app/bills/page.tsx:265 - Type error on map function
   - app/bills/page.tsx:445 - Error display type issue  
   - app/bills/page.tsx:446 - Button onClick handler type
   - app/committees/[id]/page.tsx:98 - Button asChild property
   - app/committees/[id]/page.tsx:140 - Badge size property
   - app/committees/[id]/page.tsx:168 - Button asChild property
   - app/committees/[id]/page.tsx:220 - Button asChild property

SYSTEMATIC APPROACH:

1. **Fix Button Component Usage:**
   - Remove all `asChild` properties from Button components
   - Wrap Button with Link components instead of using asChild
   - Fix onClick handler type conflicts

2. **Fix Badge Component Usage:**
   - Remove unsupported `size` properties from Badge components
   - Use only supported Badge variant properties

3. **Fix Type Assertions:**
   - Add proper type guards for error handling
   - Fix map function parameter types
   - Ensure all component prop types match interfaces

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:

1. **Run build to identify all current TypeScript errors**
2. **Fix each error systematically by file**
3. **Test build after each fix to ensure no regressions**
4. **Document any component API changes needed**

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- npm run build passes without TypeScript errors
- All Bills and Committee pages compile successfully
- No breaking changes to functionality
- Ready for production deployment

Focus on getting the build to pass so we can deploy the comprehensive Bills & Committee system.
