## 🚦 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| Auth fix complexity | HIGH | Rollback plan ready | 🟢 Managed |
| API rate limits | MEDIUM | Caching layer planned | 🟢 Managed |
| Mobile performance | MEDIUM | Progressive enhancement | 🟢 Managed |
| Deployment conflicts | LOW | Phased deployment | 🟢 Managed |

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Feature Dev**: Should prioritize caching implementation for API calls
2. **Bug Hunter**: Consider implementing refresh token rotation
3. **UI/UX**: Focus on critical mobile breakpoints first (375px, 428px)
4. **Performance**: Establish alerts for Core Web Vitals regressions

## 📝 Notes for Next Update (1:30 PM)

- Check Feature Dev assessment completion
- Verify Bug Hunter progress on auth fix
- Review Performance Engineer baseline metrics
- Coordinate any cross-team dependencies
