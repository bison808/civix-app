- ✅ Added Web Vitals tracking (CLS, FCP, LCP, TTFB, INP)
- ✅ Implemented resource timing monitoring
- ✅ Added memory usage tracking

### 7. Bundle Analysis
- ✅ Added bundle analyzer for ongoing optimization
- ✅ Created npm script: `npm run analyze`

## 📊 Performance Improvements

### Before Optimizations
- First Load JS: ~116KB (average)
- No caching strategy
- No lazy loading
- Basic React Query setup
- No performance monitoring

### After Optimizations
- First Load JS: **86.9KB** (25% reduction)
- Proper caching at all levels
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Optimized bundle splitting
- Complete performance monitoring

## 🎯 Next Steps for Further Optimization

### High Priority
1. **Database Migration**
   - Move from hardcoded data to PostgreSQL/Supabase
   - Implement proper data pagination
   - Add database indexing

2. **CDN Implementation**
   - Deploy static assets to CDN
   - Configure edge caching
   - Implement geo-distributed content

3. **API Optimization**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add request batching
   - Use GraphQL for efficient data fetching

### Medium Priority
1. **Service Worker**
   - Implement offline support
   - Add push notifications
   - Cache API responses

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Convert existing JPEGs to WebP
   - Generate multiple sizes
   - Implement art direction

3. **Font Optimization**
   - Use font-display: swap
   - Subset fonts
   - Preload critical fonts

### Low Priority
1. **Advanced Monitoring**
   - Integrate Sentry for error tracking
   - Add custom performance metrics
   - Implement A/B testing for performance

## 🛠️ Usage Commands

```bash
# Regular build
npm run build

# Build with bundle analysis
npm run analyze

# Development with performance logging
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## 📈 Monitoring Performance

The performance monitoring system automatically tracks:
- Core Web Vitals (CLS, FCP, LCP, TTFB, INP)
- Resource loading times
- Memory usage
- Custom performance marks

In development, metrics are logged to console.
In production, metrics would be sent to analytics endpoint.

## 🔍 Bundle Analysis

To analyze bundle size:
```bash
npm run analyze
```

This will open a visual representation of the bundle, helping identify:
- Large dependencies
- Duplicate code
- Optimization opportunities

## ⚡ Quick Wins Remaining

1. **Reduce Logo File Sizes**
   - Current: 144KB (civix-logo.jpeg), 62KB (citzn-logo.jpeg)
   - Target: <20KB each with WebP conversion

2. **Enable Brotli Compression**
   - Add to Netlify configuration
   - Can reduce transfer size by 15-20%

3. **Implement Request Deduplication**
   - Prevent duplicate API calls
   - Use React Query's built-in deduplication

4. **Add Resource Hints**
   - Preconnect to API domains
   - Prefetch critical resources
   - DNS prefetch for third-party domains
