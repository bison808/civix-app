   - Direct integration with CA.gov APIs
   - Secretary of State data integration
   - District boundary management

3. **Integrated California Service** (`services/integratedCaliforniaState.service.ts`)
   - Unified interface for all California state data
   - Data merging from multiple sources
   - Enhanced search and filtering capabilities

```

### Search Representatives
